1,erica,"""I understand you wanted to see me? Is it because I’ve been missing classes? It’s just this is literally my fourth school since freshman year and I’m probably gonna have to move again next summer so it’s hard to take class too seriously.""",
1,bad1,"""I understand, but I'm worried you won't graduate. Teachers aren't going to pass you if you continue to miss their classes.""","""Sounds like you’re concerned about Erica’s success. This response <span class=""bold"">confronts</span> her with potential negative consequences, which can lead to defensiveness and unwillingness to change the status quo. Try a different response that offers a <span class=""bold"">reflection</span> or restatement about what she might be concerned about here."""
1,good,"""It sounds like you’re getting frustrated with changing schools so often.""","""Good choice! You’re echoing what Erica’s telling you in a way that demonstrates that you understand what she’s feeling. This is called a <span class=""bold"">reflection</span>, and will help build trust and foster a sense of safety."""
1,bad2,"""I get it, but you need to attend school. Just go to more classes.""","""Here you’ve <span class=""bold"">directed</span> Erica to do what you think she should do. This puts you in a position of being an expert rather than a partner in thinking through her dilemma. Try a different response that offers a <span class=""bold"">reflection</span> or restatement about what she might be concerned about here."""
2,erica,"""Yeah, like it really sucks. Anyway, I just kinda wanna get through the school year without getting too wrapped with stuff here.""",
2,good,"""I'm sure it must be hard to have to try to make new friends every time you move.""","""Good supportive statement! This response shows sympathy and is <span class=""bold"">supportive</span> of Erica. Let’s see what she chooses to divulge…"""
2,bad1,"""You’re gonna flunk out with an attitude like that.""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">warn</span> Erica about negative consequences. Warnings generally produce defensiveness and will push Erica to argue against change. Try a supportive response."""
2,bad2,"""Isolating yourself isn’t really working for you now, is it?""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">confront</span> Erica by criticizing her current behavior; this may deflate her sense of self-efficacy and produce defensiveness. Try a supportive response."""
3,erica,"""I don’t know, maybe it’s too late. I’ll just be better about going to classes at my next school, I guess.""",
3,good,"""I have some concerns about that plan — do you mind if I share them?""","""Nice job <span class=""bold"">raising concern with permission</span>. This shows that you care about Erica and also support her autonomy by giving her a choice to hear your concerns."""
3,bad1,"""Where are you moving next year?""","""You’ve chosen a <span class=""bold"">closed question</span> to gather a specific fact about Erica. This moves the conversation away from change and away from Erica’s primary concerns. Try a different response."""
3,bad2,"""But what makes you think next time is going to be any different?""","""Here you have chosen to <span class=""bold"">confront</span> Erica to show that you think next time will be the same; you are taking an expert stance instead of being collaborative. Try a different method of bringing up your perspective that <span class=""bold"">supports</span> Erica’s autonomy in making choices."""
4,erica,"""I don’t think I need advice. It’s just that I always... never mind.""",
4,bad1,"""Look, I can’t help you unless you tell me what’s going on.""","""Here you are choosing to <span class=""bold"">confront</span> Erica with a directive to tell you what is going on.

4,bad2,"""Don’t worry about your high school friends. Trust me, in about ten years you won’t even remember their names.""","""Here you are giving <span class=""bold"">advice without permission</span> by telling Erica what to feel and what to do.

I'd really like to hear your thoughts about this.""","""Good <span class=""bold"">complex reflection!</span> You’ve reflected Erica’s feelings of fear and concerns about confidentiality. A complex reflection both demonstrates your understanding of Erica’s experience and reflects the feelings beneath the surface of what she said. This skill helps you to establish a sense of trust and safety."""
5,erica,"""Well, no offense to the school or anything but, like, going to school is exhausting to me.""",
5,bad1,"""You really need to sleep more.""","""Here you have <span class=""bold"">directed</span> Erica about what she should do.  Directions do not communicate that you’re interested in what might be bothering her. Try a different response to see if you can find out more."""
5,good,"""I can imagine you’ve been under a lot of stress — moving so many times must be taxing. What about going to school feels exhausting to you?""","""Good! This response provides <span class=""bold"">reflection</span> followed by an <span class=""bold"">open-ended question</span>.  These listening skills show you are willing to understand what she’s telling you."""

Tell me more about that.""","""This was a good moment to provide a <span class=""bold"">complex reflection</span> to what Erica said, which demonstrates that you are listening. You then used an <span class=""bold"">open-ended question</span> to encourage her to share more about what is keeping her from attending class."""
6,bad2,"""No one wants to be there, but they all manage to get to class.""","""You have chosen to <span class=""bold"">confront</span> Erica by suggesting she is the only one that struggles with going to school; this may make her feel judged and defensive.

8,bad1,"""You’re too smart a student to get this upset about dance.""","""This response is <span class=""bold"">confrontational</span> and doesn’t demonstrate empathy with the fact that dance is important to her. Try a different response."""

13,erica,"""I’m not sure… I’m just really nervous and I don’t know what I would say to them… can you help me figure that out?""","""It sounds like Erica’s ready to make a change and start planning her next steps – and your responses helped her feel able and empowered to do so! <br><br>By tying the attendance issue to her desire to improve things with her friends, you provided a more effective motivation for her to attend class. Her friend problems are a primary source of pain for her. Helping her see the connection between her friend challenges and her attendance helps to address that source of pain and the need for improved attendance far more effectively than fear of getting expelled or poor grade performance. <br><br>Hopefully this exercise has helped you feel more familiar with the basic listening skills including reflections, affirmations, open-ended questions and emphasizing control — being able to identify these skills is an important step towards integrating them into your practice!"""
